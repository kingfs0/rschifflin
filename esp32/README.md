# QEMU(Tutorials of ESP32)

## 1.Introduction

QEMU can simulate the kernel to run on different boards ,eliminate dependence on physical development boards. The esp32 subdirectory contains part of the OpenHarmony kernel\_liteos\_m code verified by the Qemu esp32 virtualization platform, it can be used to simulate a single-core esp32 single board.

## 2.Setup Environment

   1. Install esp-idf

      Please refer to the installation instructions: (https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.1/get-started/index.html)

      Annotation: The installation of esp-idf can be skipped. The bootloader.bin and partition-table.bin generated have been placed in the vendor\ohemu\qemu_xtensa_mini_system_demo\image folder.

      Annotation: If you skip the installation of esp-idf, you can install the toolchain as follows:

      Tip: Users can also skip this step by using the following instructions directly to use the compiler configured in the default environment.

      To use the default environment, execute '3.Get source code' and then install the default compiler in the root directory by executing the following instructions.

         ```shell
         sh build/prebuilts_download.sh
         ```

      Optional compiler installation process:

      a) Download the esp official release the SDK package: https://www.espressif.com/zh-hans/support/download/sdks-demos?keys=&field_type_tid%5B%5D=13

      b) Put the downloaded SDK package into the Linux system, go to the directory, and run the following commands:

         ```shell
         unzip esp-idf-v4.3.1.zip
         cd esp-idf-v4.3.1/
         ./install.sh
         . ./export.sh
         ```

      c) Delete the default compiler path:

         change esp32\liteos_m\config.gni:

         ```c
         board_toolchain_path = "$ohos_root_path/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/esp/esp-2019r2-8.2.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/"
         ```

         to

         ```c
         board_toolchain_path = ""
         ```

      Annotation: The version of the toolchain used in the test is GCC Version 8.2.0 (Crosstool-ng ESP-2019R2) or GCC Version 8.4.0 (Crosstool-ng ESP-2021R1).  

   2. Install esptool

      a) In step 1, the export.sh script will set the esptool in the environment path, you need to ensure that the esptool version is 3.1 and above.
         ```shell
         esptool.py version
         ```
      b) If the version of the esptool that comes with esp-idf is too low, delete the environment variable corresponding to the current esptool path and run the following commands. (The recommended python version is 3.8 and above)
         ```shell
         python -m pip install esptool
         ```

   3. Compile qemu-system-xtensa

      a) Install and compile

         ```shell
         git clone https://github.com/espressif/qemu.git
         cd qemu
         ./configure --target-list=xtensa-softmmu \
            --enable-gcrypt \
            --enable-debug --enable-sanitizers \
            --disable-strip --disable-user \
            --disable-capstone --disable-vnc \
            --disable-sdl --disable-gtk
         ```

      b) Waitting for the completion of the compilation and executing the installation command (If the compilation fail, please refer to https://github.com/espressif/qemu/issues/21):

         ```shell
         ninja -C build
         ```

      c) Add qemu to the environment variable (modify user_qemu_xxx_path to your own installation path)：

         ```shell
         vim ~/.bashrc
         export QEMU=user_qemu_xxx_path/qemu/build
         source ~/.bashrc
         ```

      d) Installation dependencies

         ```shell
         ldd $QEMU/qemu-system-xtensa
         ```

         According to the execution result of ldd, install the missing dependent libraries

         (Annotation: For more installation instructions, please refer to the following link: [Home · espressif/qemu Wiki · GitHub](https://github.com/espressif/qemu/wiki#configure))

## 3.Get source code

[code acquisition ](https://gitee.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/device-dev/get-code/sourcecode-acquire.md)

Hint : You can use the `repo` command to get the source code.

## 4.Source buildding

   1. Execute the hb set command and select the project `qemu_xtensa_mini_system_demo`.

   2. Execute the hb clean && hb build command to build the executable file that produces `OHOS_Image`.

      ```shell
      hb set
      hb clean && hb build
      ```

   3. After the buildding is complete, the corresponding executable file is in the home directory：

      ```
      out/esp32/qemu_xtensa_mini_system_demo/
      ```

## 5.Run the image in Qemu

   1. Run qemu(Don't cooperate with GDB )

      ```shell
      ./qemu-run
      ```

   2. Run qemu(Cooperate with GDB)

      a) Start the GDB server and wait for the connection

         ```shell
         ./qemu-run -g
         ```

      b) Create a new terminal and use GDB to connect to qemu

         ```shell
         xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb out/esp32/qemu_xtensa_mini_system_demo/OHOS_Image -ex "target remote :1234"
         ```

   Annotation：Since the qemu-system-xtensa tool of qemu has the same name as the qemu-system-xtensa tool of esp32, the absolute path is used to execute the qemu-system-xtensa tool of esp32.
   Annotation：The way to exit qemu : press ctrl and a, then release and press x.
